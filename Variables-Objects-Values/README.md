# Variables, Objects and Values
* Id is a unique number provided for every varibales
* All variables are  objects
* Values compared by: '''==''' ('''True/False''' boolean)
* Ids compared by: '''is''' ('''True/False''' boolean)
* Booleans are also objects. they have id, they can be either assigend to a variable or compared

## What is mutable or immutable in programming

### Immutable:
* Cannot change (edit) entry.
* Can set a new value. (supporting '''+=''', '''-=''', '''=''')
* The id changes every time when you set a value
* Two different immutable variables with the same value has same ids
### Mutable:
* Can change (edit) entry.
* Can set a new value. (supporting '''+=''', '''-=''', '''=''')
* The id remains the same while editing. on the other hand, but it is changed when you set a value
* Two different mutable variables with the same value has different ids

## Which is what?!
* Tuples are immutable
* Integers are immutable
* Strings are immutable
* Dictionaries are mutable
* Lists are mutable



## Integers
* Use '''/''' for float type devision and '''//''' for interger type devision
* Integer item cannot be subscripted. (no '''num[1] = 1''')


## Strings
* string item cannot be assigend to a new value. (no '''s[1] = "a"''')
