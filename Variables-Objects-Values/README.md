# Variables, Objects and Values
* id is a unique number provided for every varibales
* all variables are  objects
* values compared by: == (True/False boolean)
* ids compared by: is (True/False boolean)
* booleans are also objects. they have id, they can be either assigend to a variable or compared

## what is mutable or immutable in programming

### immutable:
* cannot change (edit) entry.
* can set a new value. (supporting +=, -=, =)
* the id changes every time when you set a value
* two different immutable variables with the same value has same ids
### mutable:
* can change (edit) entry.
* can set a new value. (supporting +=, -=, =)
* the id remains the same while editing. on the other hand, but it is changed when you set a value
* two different mutable variables with the same value has different ids

tuples are immutable
integers are immutable
strings are immutable
dictionaries are mutable
lists are mutable



# important notes:
# use / for float type devision and // for interger type devision
# integer item cannot be subscripted. (no num[1] = 1)



# important notes:
# string item cannot be assigend to a new value. (no s[1] = "a")
